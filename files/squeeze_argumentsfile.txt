Enter your options:

       -s <server>[:<port>]
              Connect to the specified Logitech Media Server,  otherwise  uses
              automatic  discovery  to  find server on the local network. This
              option should only be needed if  automatic  discovery  does  not
              work,  or  the  server is not on the local network segment (e.g.
              behind a router).

       -a <params>
              Specify parameters used when opening  an  audio  output  device.
              For  ALSA,  the  format <b>:<p>:<f>:<m> is used where <b> is the
              buffer time in milliseconds (values less than 500)  or  size  in
              bytes  (default 40ms); <p> is the period count (values less than
              50) or size in bytes (default 4  periods);  <f>  is  the  sample
              format  (possible values: 16, 24, 24_3 or 32); <m> is whether to
              use mmap (possible values: 0 or 1).  For PortAudio, the value is
              simply  the  target  latency in milliseconds. When the output is
              sent to standard output, the value can be 16, 24  or  32,  which
              denotes the sample size in bits.

       -b <stream>:<output>
              Specify internal stream and output buffer sizes in kilobytes.

       -c <codec1>,...
              Restrict codecs to those specified, otherwise load all available
              codecs; known codecs: flac, pcm, mp3, ogg, aac, wma, alac.   mad
              or  mpg can be supplied instead of mp3 to use a specific decoder
              library.

       -d <category>=<level>
              Set logging  level.  Categories  are:  all,  slimproto,  stream,
              decode  or  output.   Levels can be: info, debug or sdebug.  The
              option can be repeated to set different log levels for different
              categories.

       -m <mac addr>
              Override the player's MAC address. The  format  must  be  colon-
              delimited  hexadecimal,  for example: ab:cd:ef:12:34:56. This is
              usually automatically  detected,  and  should  not  need  to  be
              provided in most circumstances.

       -p <priority>
              Set real time priority of output thread (1-99; default 45).  Not
              applicable when using PortAudio.

       -r <rates>
              Specify  sample  rates  supported  by the output device; this is
              required if the output device is switched off  when  squeezelite
              is started. The format is either a single maximum sample rate, a
              range of sample rates in the format  <min>-<max>,  or  a  comma-
              separated list of available rates.

       -u|-R [params]
              Enable upsampling of played audio. The argument is optional; see
              RESAMPLING (below) for more information. The options -u  and  -R
              are synonymous.

       -D     Output  device  supports DSD over PCM (DoP). DSD streams will be
              converted to DoP before output. If this option is not  supplied,
              DSD  streams will be converted to PCM and resampled, so they can
              be played on a PCM DAC.

       -v     Enable visualiser support. This creates a shared memory  segment
              that  contains  some  of  the  audio  being  played,  so that an
              external  visualiser  can  read  and  process  this  to   create
              visualisations.

       -z     Cause  squeezelite  to  run  as  a  daemon. That is, it detaches
              itself from the terminal and runs in the background.

       -t     Display version and license information.

RESAMPLING

       Audio can be resampled or upsampled before being  sent  to  the  output
       device.  This  can  be  enabled  simply  by  passing  the  -u option to
       squeezelite, but further configuration can be given as an  argument  to
       the option.

       Resampling   is   performed   using  the  SoX  Resampler  library;  the
       documentation for that library and the SoX rate effect many be  helpful
       when configuring upsampling for squeezelite.

       The          format          of         the         argument         is
       <recipe>:<flags>:<attenuation>:<precision>:<passband_end>:<stopband_start>:<phase_response>

   recipe
       This  part  of  the  argument  string is made up of a number of single-
       character flags: [v|h|m|l|q][L|I|M][s][E|X]. The default value is hL.

       v, h, m, l or q
              are mutually  exclusive  and  correspond  to  very  high,  high,
              medium, low or quick quality.

       L, I or M
              correspond to linear, intermediate or minimum phase.

       s      changes  resampling bandwidth from the default 95% (based on the
              3dB point) to 99%.

       E      exception - avoids resampling if the output device supports  the
              playback sample rate natively.

       X      resamples  to  the  maximum  sample  rate  for the output device
              ("asynchronous" resampling).

       Examples
              -u vLs would use very high quality setting, linear phase  filter
              and steep cut-off.
              -u hM would specify high quality, with the minimum phase filter.
              -u hMX would specify high quality, with the minimum phase filter
              and async upsampling to max device rate.

   flags
       The second optional argument to -u  allows  the  user  to  specify  the
       following arguments (taken from the soxr.h header file), in hex:

       #define SOXR_ROLLOFF_SMALL     0u  /* <= 0.01 dB */
       #define SOXR_ROLLOFF_MEDIUM    1u  /* <= 0.35 dB */
       #define SOXR_ROLLOFF_NONE      2u  /* For Chebyshev bandwidth. */

       #define SOXR_MAINTAIN_3DB_PT   4u  /* Reserved for internal use. */
       #define  SOXR_HI_PREC_CLOCK      8u   /*  Increase  'irrational'  ratio
       accuracy. */
       #define SOXR_DOUBLE_PRECISION 16u  /* Use D.P. calcs even if  precision
       <= 20. */
       #define   SOXR_VR                32u   /*  Experimental,  variable-rate
       resampling. */

       Examples
              -u :2 would specify SOXR_ROLLOFF_NONE.

              NB: In the example above the first option,  <quality>,  has  not
              been  specified so would default to hL. Therefore, specifying -u
              :2 is equivalent to having specified -u hL:2.

   attenuation
       Internally, data is passed to  the  SoX  resample  process  as  32  bit
       integers  and  output from the SoX resample process as 32 bit integers.
       Why does this matter?  There is the possibility that  integer  samples,
       once  resampled  may  be  clipped  (i.e.  exceed the maximum value). By
       default, if you do not specify an attenuation value, it will default to
       -1db.  A  value  of 0 on the command line, i.e. -u ::0 will disable the
       default -1db attenuation being applied.

       NB: Clipped samples will be logged. Keep an eye on the log file.

       Examples
              -u ::6 specifies to apply -6db (ie. halve the volume)  prior  to
              the resampling process.

   precision
       The  internal 'bit' precision used in the re-sampling calculations (ie.
       quality).

       NB: HQ = 20, VHQ = 28.

       Examples
              -u :::28 specifies 28-bit precision.

   passband_end
       A percentage value  between  0  and  100,  where  100  is  the  Nyquist
       frequency. The default if not explicitly set is 91.3.

       Examples
              -u  ::::98  specifies passband ends at 98 percent of the Nyquist
              frequency.

   stopband_start
       A percentage value  between  0  and  100,  where  100  is  the  Nyquist
       frequency. The default if not explicitly set is 100.

       Examples
              -u  :::::100  specifies  that the stopband starts at the Nyquist
              frequency.

   phase_response
       A value between 0-100, where 0 is equivalent to the recipe M  flag  for
       minimum  phase,  25 is equivalent to the recipe I flag for intermediate
       phase and 50 is equivalent to the recipe L flag for linear phase.

       Examples
              -u ::::::50 specifies linear phase.
